To enable NSApplicationDelegate.applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState in your macOS application, you'll need to implement the applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState method in your NSApplicationDelegate class. This method should return true to indicate that your application supports secure restorable state.

Here's a step-by-step guide:

Open your macOS project in Xcode.

Locate your AppDelegate class, which conforms to the NSApplicationDelegate protocol. This is usually in a file named AppDelegate.swift or AppDelegate.m (for Swift or Objective-C projects, respectively).

Implement the applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState method. This method should return true. Below are examples in both Swift and Objective-C.

Swift
swift
Copy code
import Cocoa

@NSApplicationMain
class AppDelegate: NSObject, NSApplicationDelegate {

    func applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState(_ app: NSApplication) -> Bool {
        return true
    }

    // Other app delegate methods...
}
Objective-C
objective
Copy code
#import <Cocoa/Cocoa.h>

@interface AppDelegate : NSObject <NSApplicationDelegate>
@end

@implementation AppDelegate

- (BOOL)applicationSupportsSecureRestorableState:(NSApplication *)app {
    return YES;
}

// Other app delegate methods...
@end
Build and run your application to ensure there are no errors and that the new functionality is properly enabled.
By implementing this method, you are informing macOS that your application supports saving and restoring its state securely. This is especially useful for apps that manage sensitive data or complex states that you want to preserve across app launches.
